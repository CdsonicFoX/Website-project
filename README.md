# Bootstrap-schoolproject 
this is a school project where I learned Bootstrap, Bulma and Tailwind for a week (we call it a deepdive at our school.) 

This project right here is a Bootstrap website where I had spend 2 days on recreating the school website. In my opion for somebody that has never worked with any frameworks and has 6 months exprerience in HTML/CSS that this is pretty okay.
